This plugin lets you show the data from Meteohub all-sensors.txt file easily in the content of your website using shorttags.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you show the data from Meteohub all-sensors.txt file easily in the content of your website using shorttags.

For example:<br>
`Temperature: [meteohub sensor='actual_th1_temp_c']&deg;C<br>
Max windspeed: [meteohub sensor='alltime_wind0_maxspeeddir_nl'] [meteohub sensor='alltime_wind0_gustspeedmax_bft'] bft ([meteohub sensor='alltime_wind0_gustspeedmax_kmh']) on [meteohub sensor='alltime_wind0_gustspeedmax_time']
<br><br>
will result in:
<br><br>
Temperature: 9&deg;C<br>
Max windspeed: NNW 12.4 bft (130.3 km/h) on 28-10-2013 at 12:31<br>`

The plugin automatically rewrites the date and time according to your WordPress time and date settings, and trend values get rewritten to arrow images.

I am in no way, shape or form affiliated with Meteohub and do not in any way profit from commissions or referrals to them.
